   git clone https://github.com/magnussimonsen/TouchPy.git
   cd TouchPy
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the typing trainer:

```bash
python run.py
```

Or run directly from the typing_trainer directory:

```bash
cd typing_trainer
python app.py
```

## Building to Executable (.exe)

You can build TouchPy into a standalone Windows executable that doesn't require Python to be installed!

### Quick Build

Run the automated build script:

```powershell
.\build.ps1
```

This will create `dist\TouchPy\TouchPy.exe` that you can share with others.

### Distribution

After building:

1. The executable is in `dist\TouchPy\TouchPy.exe`
2. Share the entire `dist\TouchPy` folder
3. Users can run `TouchPy.exe` directly (no Python needed!)

For detailed build instructions and customization options, see [BUILD.md](BUILD.md).

## Adding Custom Exercises

**For .exe users:** You can add new exercises without rebuilding!

1. Create an `exercises` folder next to `TouchPy.exe`
2. Add `.txt` files with this format:
   - Line 1: Exercise title
   - Rest: Exercise text

See [EXERCISES_README.md](EXERCISES_README.md) for detailed instructions.

**For developers:** Add `.txt` files to `typing_trainer/exercises/` or `exercises/` folder.
